  "body": "# Node-Red Home Sprinkler System \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a home sprinkler system using Node-Red hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  I used the Node-Red-Dashboard Node to implement a GUI to control four (4) area home sprinkler system.  At the moment I just have LEDs attached to the Raspberry PI GPIO, but I plan to use a relay board to control the sprinkler valves. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Node-Red \r\nI recently upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 3 and installed Jessie OS.  Node-Red is pre-installed in the OS.  I did need to install the node-red-dashboard for this project.  Installing Nodes is very straight forward, and very well documented.\r\n\r\n- [Running on Raspberry Pi](http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi)\r\n\r\n- [node-red-dashboard download]( http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Node-Red Flow\r\n\r\nThis project includes two flows, and they are linked together through a menu.\r\n\r\n#### Flow 1 : Provides a way trigger the sprinkler system to turn on for a configurable set of time.  \r\n![flow1.jpg](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/flow1.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Flow 2 : Provides a way to manually control the sprinkler system by using a standard ON/OFF switch.\r\n![flow2.jpg](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/flow2.jpg)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Mobile App GUI\r\n\r\n![mobileflow1](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/mobile_flow1.png)\r\n\r\n![mobileflow2](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/mobile_flow2.png)\r\n\r\n![mobilemenu](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/mobile_menu.png)\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Webpage (PC) GUI\r\n\r\n\r\n![web_flow1](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/web_flow1.jpg)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Raspberry PI LED (Soon to be replaced with Relay Board)\r\n\r\n![rpi_led2](http://odelay.io/projects/Sprinkler/rpi_led2.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
